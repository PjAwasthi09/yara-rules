Malware or Malicious Software is a file or code, typically delivered over a network, that infects, explores, steals or conducts virtually any behavior an attacker wants. Though varied in type and capabilities, malware usually has one of the following objectives:

   • Provide remote control for an attacker to use an infected machine.
    
   • Send spam from the infected machine to unsuspecting targets.
    
   • Investigate the infected user’s local network.
    
   • Steal Sensitive Data.
